# accessibility-standards-challenge

## Description

The goal of this project is to increase search engine optimization for a marketing agencies' webpage, make the webpage accesible for people with disabilities, and clean up existing code. To do this, all non semantic code elements were switched to a more appropriate element. The structure of the html and css were rearranged to a sequential order and spaces were added for easier reading. All images and or icons were given an alternative text attribute to be understood by screen readers. A broken link was also found and fixed within the navigation section of the page. This website is now able to be used with only a keyboard in the event a mouse is not able to be used or any other web access tools. Making these changes also allow for the site to be moved up in a search engine's rankings.
